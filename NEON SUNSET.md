# **<u>NEON SUNSET</u>**

*A Cyberpunk Roleplaying Game by Craig Chouraki-Lewin* - [blog](http://www.diaghilevsdice.blogspot.com), [email](mailto:CSLewin@gmail.com)

# What kind of game is this? 

To summarize Patrick Stuart summarizing Gregory Blair, Brian Harbron, FM Geist, Zedeck Siew, Brian Murphy, Dirk Detweiler Leichty and Daniel Davis:

**[REWRITE THESE AND EXPLAIN WHAT EACH ONE MEANS; DON'T BE A HIPSTER ABOUT IT]**

1. This is a game about interacting with this world as if it were a place that exists.
2. Killing things is not the goal.
3. There is nothing that is “supposed” to happen.
4. Unknowability and consequence make everything interesting.
5. You play as your character, not as the screenwriter writing your character.
6. It’s your job to make your character interesting and to make the game interesting for you.
7. If you find yourself in a fair fight, your tactics suck.
8. The answer is not on your character sheet.
9. Things are swingy.
10. You will die.

# What Does It Mean To Be Alive? [TODO]

I'm playing it pretty cool with AI in this. I'd like to actually avoid AI NPCs. I feel it makes them too commonplace.

You can interact with "AI", but the best are more like very good Expert System/well-trained neural nets, focused on a specific task. There's no common Strong/General AI... probably.

I don't want a monolithic antagonist; Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (the FAANG corporations) remain separate legal entities, and *individually*, they're the corporations of today, just bigger and deeper and stronger by a few decades. They're so enmeshed in each other and the global economy/technological sphere, however, that their interdependence arguably creates a corporate meta-entity. Basically, I want to ask: *If a General AI autonomously emerged, how would we even know?*

Imagine it's non-biological and has no interest in communicating with humans, but is capable of agentic behavior, self-preservation, and growth/expansion. Does it qualify as an organism? Does it qualify as intelligent?

What if the entity is competing for the same resources as humans? What if the components of the entity--individual corporations, departments within those corporations, humans within those departments--don't realize they're functionally organelles? What if they're incentivized to continue behaving as such?

What if the choices it makes can kill you?

# Core Mechanics

When someone attempts a task at which they are basically competent, they succeed without rolling if they aren't rushed, nobody is directly opposing their efforts, and they aren't otherwise distracted or confounded. A good plan can often make rolls unnecessary. If time, circumstance, opposition, or random chance are relevant, a roll is made to determine success or failure. 

Roll 1d10 and add your relevant stat, relevant skill, and any modifiers from your equipment and circumstances. If no skill applies, only add your stat, gear and circumstance modifiers. The roll is a success if the total meets or beats the target number (TN). If someone is directly opposing your efforts, the target number of your attempt is the result of your opponent's roll.

**Remember: 1d10 + Stat + Skill. Meet or beat the Target Number (TN) to succeed.**

For each **advantage** on a roll, roll an additional d10 and use the **highest** single die rolled. Advantage is written as "+1d".
For each **disadvantage** on a roll, roll an additional d10 and use the **lowest** single die rolled. Disadvantage is written as "-1d".

*Example: A metabolic filter is cyberware that grants +1d to resist the effects of poison. Usually, attempting to resist a poison means you’d roll 1d10 + Grit against the TN of the poison. If you have a metabolic filter installed, you’d roll one additional d10 and only add your Grit to the highest result from all the d10s you rolled before comparing the total to the TN.*

**You can have a maximum of three advantages and three disadvantages applied to a single roll.** Individual advantages and disadvantages on the same roll cancel each other out. Diminishing returns start around two or three dis/advantages; it's just not worth tracking any more than that.

*Example: If you have three sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage on a roll, you'll roll with two advantages, or "+2d". Roll a total of three d10s and use the single highest result.*

## Example Target Numbers (TN)

| Target Number        | **How hard is this task?**                                   | Example                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trivial: TN 5**    | Any average person can reliably do this unless severely distracted or opposed. | Writing an email response in your headware implant while navigating a crowded sidewalk. |
| **Easy: TN 10**      | An average person of average skill can accomplish this task unless distracted or opposed. | Swapping a dead battery in your electric scooter in time to get to work. |
| **Moderate: TN 15**  | An average person of average skill can get this done in a few moments; a skilled master or a natural-born genius finds this task trivial. | Clearing the chamber of a jammed heatblock pistol while under heavy gunfire. |
| **Hard: TN 20**      | A taxing task even for someone naturally adept and highly skilled. | Hacking an active corporate data core using an off-the-rack cyberdeck. |
| **Heroic: TN 25**    | The world's finest find this task iffy, even without distractions, but not impossible. | Avoiding patient infection during surgical installation of bioware outside of a sterile operating room. |
| **Legendary: TN 30** | Accomplishing this task is virtually impossible without extraordinary talent, masterful skill, excellent gear, and a good bit of luck. | Scaling a skyscraper's exterior from street level to the roof during an acid rain typhoon. |

## Common Circumstance Modifiers

| Situation or Condition                                       | Modified Roll                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Missing important (but not crucial) tools or information     | -1d to complete the task                 |
| Attempting a non-combat task while actively being attacked   | -1d on attempts while under attack       |
| Drunk or intoxicated to the point of difficulty walking a straight line | -1d on just about everything until sober |
| Using superior/bleeding-edge technology or rare, profound insight | +1d to complete the task                 |
| Attacking an unaware target                                  | +1d to strike the target                 |

## Additional Mechanical Notes

When interpreting written rules, the specific trumps the general. However, the only game that matters it the one that happens at your table, and the GM's decisions are final. If character death is on the line, take five minutes to talk it out.

When rounding, always round down to the nearest whole number.

# Character Creation

## Summary

- Pick a Focus: Combat, Social, or Tech
- Pick an Approach: Institutional, Self-Reliance, Community
- Determine your initial Professional Reputation and General Reputation
- Spend 30 points across your six stats.
- Spend 30 points across your desired skills.
- Pick areas of expertise for each skill with at least one rank.
- Fill out your Civilian License: Name, Age, Country of Origin, Sex, Height, Weight, Current Eye Color, Current Hair Color, Current Cyberware/Augmentations, Criminal History

Your character is not complete until you have an answer to these questions:

- "What prevents you from working a normal job and living a normal life?"
- "Why have you chosen to associate with career criminals?"

## Focus

Select your primary Focus: **Combat**, **Social**, or **Tech**. Although you're capable of many other tasks, your Focus defines your main skill set.

### Combat Focus

Your business is discriminate violence; dealing death while surviving the same.

- Divide 2 free stat points among Might, Grace, and Luck.
- Divide 4 free skill points among Perception, Shooting, Athletics, Brawling, and Swordplay.
- You don't have to spend an action to reload a personal weapon. Everyone else does.
- You have a +1d bonus to all attacks. You are considered to have all weapons as areas of expertise.
- You recognize weapons and armor. The GM will provide details (armor value, damage, etc.) when asked.

### Social Focus

Your primary faculties are interpersonal; negotiation, manipulation, and coercion.

- Divide 2 free stat points among Charm, Lore, and Luck.
- Divide 4 free skill points among Perception, Tracking, Streetwise, Stealth, and Manipulate.
- You have all Manipulate approaches as areas of expertise. You can spend Manipulation areas of expertise on groups of people (Gangers, Corporates, Cops, etc.) and receive +1d on all rolls to interact with them.
- Reroll a failed Manipulate check once per session. The check must use a different approach than what failed.
- You start the game with 8 additional Professional Reputation points to distribute as you see fit.

### Tech Focus

Your talents involve electronic, mechanical, or biological systems; building, fixing, or modifying them. 

- Divide 2 free stat points among Grit, Lore, and Luck. 
- Divide 4 free skill points among Technology, Streetwise, Driving, Medicine, and Manipulate.
- All applications of the Technology skill are considered an area of expertise for you. You can spend Technology areas of expertise on sub-categories of the skill's use (Electronics - Computers, or Gunsmithing - Rifles) and receive +1d on all rolls within that sub-category.
- You're familiar with modern technology. The GM will provide details (make, model, material, function) when asked. 

## Approach

Select your character's Approach--the means through which they apply their Focus. Your Approach largely determines the groups with whom you personally associate, and is reflected in your Professional Reputations.

### Institutional

You get things done by drawing on powerful formal institutions, legal or otherwise. Corporations, governments, law enforcement bodies, gangs, and organized crime syndicates are all examples of institutions.

- Combat/Institutional Examples: Cop, Corporate Security, Government Agent, Mob Enforcer, Ninja Clan Assassin
- Social/Institutional Examples: Attorney, Corporate Officer, Government Analyst, Private Investigator, 
- Tech/Institutional Examples: ????? **[TODO]**

### Self-Reliance

You can always count on #1. A self-reliant approach represents cultivating one's own talents rather than relying on the support of others. It's a lonely road, but you'll always see eye-to-eye with your boss.

- Combat/Self-Reliance Examples: Career Mercenary, Hired Muscle
- Social/Self-Reliance Examples: Social Media Influencer, Citizen Journalist, Actor/Performer
- Tech/Self-Reliance Examples: Street Doc, Mechanic, Armorer/Weaponsmith

### Community

You draw strength from others like you. Communities can be based on geography, ethnicity, social status, interests and hobbies, common threats, politics and philosophies, or an infinite variety of other identities.

- Combat/Community Examples: Ganger, Cult Member, Guerilla, Insurgent
- Social/Community Examples: Fixer, Information Broker, Spy/Undercover Agent
- Tech/Community Examples: Hacker, ??? **[TODO]**

## Reputation

The nine combinations of Focus and Approach are a rough equivalent to the possible areas in which you can grow your reputation. Characters defined by the same Focus/Approach combination are more alike than not, although a beat cop and a corporate security officer might disagree strongly on that point. Focus/Approach combinations are game elements, not explicit categories recognized within the world; treat them as the map, not the territory.

**Professional Reputation** within a Focus/Approach combination runs from a minimum of 0 (practically anonymous) to a maximum of 10 (internationally recognizable). Your Professional Reputation * 10 is the *percentage chance* that an NPC involved in or adjacent to the criminal underworld through which you move has heard of your exploits--probably your most well-known job and stories of the use of your highest-ranked skills.

If you're looking for uncommon or proscribed information, services, or supplies, your Professional Reputation is the chance you have of knowing someone who can get you what you want--the GM will tell you which Focus/Approach combination is most appropriate to your desires. If someone in that category owes you a favor, you can generally cash in the favor to get what you want. Otherwise, you're likely to owe them a favor in return. If your contact isn't able to get what you want, they might be able to put you in touch with someone who can--but you'll owe them a favor for making the introduction in addition to the price charged by whomever you ultimately speak to.

Most people do not share your life riding along the ragged edge of disaster. To determine your recognition among the rest of the population, you have a General Reputation. Your **General Reputation** is the sum of all your individual Professional Reputations. This total is the *percentage chance* that an NPC uninvolved in the world of professional criminals has heard of you. If this is the case, the NPC is likely to react with some apprehension, as you are a notorious career criminal and they are not. 

You start with a Professional Reputation of 2 in all areas matching your Focus and all areas matching your Approach. In your specific Focus/Approach combination, you start with a Professional Reputation of 4. Your Professional Reputation can be altered by Prior Jobs before the game begins. During gameplay and between jobs, the GM may apply changes to your Professional Reputations based on your actions and the actions of your crew.

*Example: The starting Professional and General Reputations of Mari, a Social Focus/Community Approach character with no prior jobs.*

| General Rep: 12% | Institutional | Self-Reliant | Community |
| :--------------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :-------: |
|    **Combat**    |   **0/10**    |   **0/10**   | **2/10**  |
|    **Social**    |   **2/10**    |   **2/10**   | **4/10**  |
|     **Tech**     |   **0/10**    |   **0/10**   | **2/10**  |

## Stats [TODO: EXAMPLES]

**Divide 30 points among your stats.** Remember to spend the free stat points granted by your Focus.

Each stat ranges from 1 to 10. Human average in a stat is 3; the maximum human potential is 6. Beyond that, augmentation is necessary--except for Luck, which naturally ranges from 1-10. The maximum possible value of any stat is 10.

If you start with a stat above the human maximum of 6--a perfectly valid choice--consider how you achieved this. Vat-grown muscle? Skeletal hardpoints for an assistive exoframe? Superconductive spinal implants? Germline engineering? Pheromone glands? A headware library of reference material? Extensive nanomedical supplements? There is no additional cost to start the game with a stat above 6, but an explanation and description are required--any stat above 6 will have obvious physical signs.

You have a number of stat points to spend based on the power level of the game. You should decide on this power level in a conversation between the players and the GM before the game starts. 

- **Gutterpunk Trash**: Spend **24 stat points**. Your character is close to average, for better or worse.
- **Cyberpunk Standard**: Spend **30 stat points**. You're a cut above. This is the NEON SUNSET default.
- **Dark Future Heroics**: Spend **36 stat points**. Your character is significantly stronger than average.

While severe trauma can reduce your stats during gameplay, it is not possible to increase your stats beyond their initial values. Make sure you're happy with your stats before the game begins.

If you'd like to quickly assign your stat points, consider putting 7 points in two stats, 5 points in two stats, and 3 points in two stats. If you want to be dangerous in combat, make your highest stats either Might (for hand-to-hand combat) or Grace (for ranged combat), and Grit (to survive more trauma). If you want to be great at social interactions, make your highest stats Charm and either Lore or Luck. If you want to be great at working with technology, make your highest stats Lore and either Grace or Luck.

### Might

How much force can you muster? Might contributes to melee damage, brute lifting/carrying, some athletic efforts, and some means of intimidation.

Your Brawling damage is a number of d6s equal to half your Might (rounded down, minimum 1d6). Striking with a cyberware limb adds +1d6 to this damage. Implanted melee weapons deal their listed damage or your Brawling damage, whichever requires you to roll more d6s.

- At Might 1, you have the physical power of a small child.
- At Might 3, you could haul 50lbs of dead weight for an hour with difficulty.
- At Might 6, you're a contender to win a World's Strongest Human competition.
- At Might 7 and beyond, your body shows obvious signs of augmentation, such as hydraulics, artificial muscle cables, or spinal reinforcements.
- At Might 8, you can rip the door off a car (and perform similar feats of strength) without a check.
- At Might 10, you can hammer-throw a four-door sedan about 30m. Your base brawling damage increases by +2d6.

### Grace

How deft are you? Grace contributes to avoiding physical harm, combat accuracy, and unaugmented driving.

- What can I do at Grace 1, 3, 6, 8, or 10?

### Grit

How long can you endure?

- What can I do at Grit 1, 3, 6, 8, or 10?

### Charm

How convincing are you?

- What can I do at Charm 1, 3, 6, 8, or 10?

### Lore

How much do you remember?

- What can I do at Lore 1, 3, 6, 8, or 10?

### Luck

How lucky are you?

Luck is a pool of floating Advantages. You can apply them before you roll to cancel out Disadvantages or to give yourself additional Advantages up to the usual maximum of +3d. You must announce that you're spending Luck before you roll your dice. You cannot spend Advantages from Luck after you've already rolled.



#### Secondary Stats

Secondary Stats are derived from your basic stats (Might, Grace, etc.). You can't spend points on increasing your secondary stats, but anything that changes your basic stats affects your secondary stats. Secondary stats include:

##### Speed

Speed indicates how quickly you can move on foot. Your Speed is equal to your Might + Grace in meters per round.

### Exotic Entities

If your preferred cyberpunk setting features non-human player characters--replicants, androids, aliens, elves, etc.--you can represent their extraordinary capabilities by exchanging two stat points during character creation for one permanent advantage on a specific type of roll. If you wanted to play a character with extraordinary hearing, for example, you could exchange two stat points (leaving you with 28 to spend) for one advantage on all Perception checks made to hear something. Alternatively, you could accept a permanent disadvantage on all checks using a certain skill in exchange for one additional stat point to spend during character creation. Discuss your ideas with the GM first--these modifications are an option, not a default, and these examples are only suggestions, not standards for universal comparison.

## Skills

**Divide 30 points among your skills.** Skill ranks range from 0 (untrained) to 10 (practiced expert). Remember to spend the free skill points received from your Focus. Note that these are free skill **points**, not free skill ranks.

- Ranks 1, 2, and 3 each cost **one skill point**.
- Rank 4 costs **two skill points**. At Rank 4, gain +1d on all uses of this skill.
- Ranks 5, 6, and 7 each cost **one skill point**.
- Rank 8 costs **two skill points**. At Rank 8, gain an additional +1d on all uses of this skill (total +2d).
- Ranks 9 and 10 each cost **two skill points**.
- In total, raising a skill from Rank 0 to Rank 10 costs **14 skill points**.

### Areas of Expertise

**You gain an area of expertise in a skill at ranks 1, 3, 6, and 10.** Each skill use within your area of expertise is rolled using the full value of the skill. Using a skill outside your areas of expertise cuts your total stat + skill value in half (rounded down).

*Example: Mika's Shooting skill is 2 at character creation. She selects "shotguns" as her area of expertise, and will roll 1d10 + Grace + Shooting whenever she fires a shotgun, or 1d10 + half her Grace + half her Shooting skill if she fires any other kind of weapon. During the game, she raises her Shooting skill to 7. Mika has two additional areas of expertise in Shooting, which she gained at ranks 3 and 6. Mike has selected "rifles" and "pistols"; when she fires a shotgun, rifle, or pistol, she'll roll 1d10 + Grace + Shooting. When she fires any gun that isn't a shotgun, rifle, or pistol, she'll roll 1d10 + half her Grace + half her Shooting skill.*

|           Skill Rank           | Total Cost to Raise from Rank 0 |
| :----------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Rank 1 (Area of Expertise #1)  |          1 skill point          |
|             Rank 2             |         2 skill points          |
| Rank 3 (Area of Expertise #2)  |         3 skill points          |
|          Rank 4 (+1d)          |         5 skill points          |
|             Rank 5             |         6 skill points          |
| Rank 6 (Area of Expertise #3)  |         7 skill points          |
|             Rank 7             |         8 skill points          |
|          Rank 8 (+2d)          |         10 skill points         |
|             Rank 9             |         12 skill points         |
| Rank 10 (Area of Expertise #4) |         14 skill points         |

If you'd like to quickly assign your skill points, consider putting 7 skill points into two skills, 5 skill points into two skills, and 3 skill points into two skills. This will give you two skills at Rank 6 (with 3 areas of expertise and +1d each), two skills at Rank 4 (with 2 areas of expertise and +1d each), and two skills at Rank 3 (with 2 areas of expertise each.)

### Common Skills

Skills marked with a "(C)" are **common**; everyone gains experience in them just by growing up in a society. **Common skills start at Rank 2.** They follow the usual rules for areas of expertise.

### Skill List

| Skill          | Stat               | Description/Uses                                             | Areas of Expertise                                           |

#### Special Skill Rules

##### Brawling

Your Brawling damage is a number of d6s equal to half your Might (rounded down, minimum 1d6). Striking with a cyberware limb adds +1d6 to this damage. Implanted melee weapons deal their listed damage or your Brawling damage, whichever requires you to roll more d6s.

Your martial arts knowledge is determined by the **Breadth** and **Depth** of your studies. When you put your first skill point into Brawling, you begin with Breadth 1 and Depth 1 and must immediately dedicate your first area of expertise to increase either Breadth or Depth by an additional point.

When you gain an additional area of expertise in Brawling, you must spend it to increase either your Breadth or Depth by one point. For example, at Brawling 6, you could have split your three areas of expertise into Breadth 3/Depth 2, or you could simulate an extreme focus on a single martial art as Breadth 1/Depth 4. You can spend a month in dedicated training to shift a point of Breadth to Depth, or vice versa. You cannot reduce either Breadth or Depth below 1.

When defending against a Brawling attack from another character for the first time, both fighters roll **1d6 + Breadth**. Whomever rolls highest has the technical edge and gains a number of advantages equal to their **Depth** to all Brawling attack and defense rolls made against this particular opponent. You are encouraged to yell things like "YOUR STEEL TIGER STYLE IS NO MATCH FOR MY DIESEL BOAR STANCE."

You automatically win Breadth checks against nameless NPCs. Regardless of prior outcomes, reroll the Breadth check at the start of a new encounter with the same opponent.

*Example: Morgan and Snake face off against each other, divested of all their guns and knives. Morgan, with a Brawling skill of 6 granting him three areas of expertise, has very broad training: Breadth 4, Depth 1. Snake has Brawling 6 as well, but has focused all of his areas of expertise into a single style: Breadth 1, Depth 4. Morgan charges Snake, and the two fighters both roll to see who has the edge. Morgan rolls 1d6+4. Snake rolls 1d6+1. If Morgan wins the roll, he'll enjoy a single advantage in all his attack and defense rolls involving Brawling against Snake. If Snake wins the roll, he'll enjoy **four** advantages in all his attack and defense rolls involving Brawling against Morgan.*

##### Manipulate

When you manipulate someone, it's more than merely making a request; you are attempting to convince or compel them to speak or act.

Attempting to manipulate someone uses the speaker's Manipulate skill + Charm stat. Resisting a manipulation attempt uses the target's Manipulate skill + Lore stat. While someone might claim to be wise, fearless, incorruptible, or possessed of an iron will, everyone has a weakness, and the Manipulate skill represents your ability to successfully navigate interpersonal resistance. While no human is immune to this skill, there are limits to the duration and effectiveness of its use; the Manipulate skill represents contextual coercion, not permanent mind control.

NPCs cannot attempt manipulation skill checks against PCs; while NPCs can propose whatever threats or offers the moment requires, it is always up to the player to decide how convinced they are by an NPC's words.

There are four essential approaches to manipulation. To carry any weight, each approach requires evidence that your offer, statement, or trade is actually possible, and each approach has a general consequence for failing to follow through or otherwise getting caught:

- **Deception** is an outright lie meant to convince. On a failed check, the target simply finds you unconvincing. Getting caught lying, however, will impose -1d to all future Manipulation attempts against the target.

- **Intimidation** compels the target through the threat or act of violence. A failed check requires you to carry out your threat or suffer -1d on all future Manipulation attempts against the target. If the target survives the encounter, they will generally look for a way to get back at you, directly or indirectly, for any harm or embarrassment inflicted.

- **Negotiation** trades one action for another. On a failed check, the target doesn't believe you have the means to carry out your end of the deal. If you succeed on your check but fail to deliver on your promises, you suffer -1d on all future Manipulation attempts against the target. If they were particularly reliant on your actions, they may seek additional recompense.

- **Bribery** offers money or goods in exchange for action or information. On a failed check, the target is unconvinced that your offer is worth their time or risk. Even when successful, a wise target generally won't act until the bribe is delivered.
  
  The value required to bribe someone is unpredictable. To eyeball an amount, the GM should roll 3d6 to find the base bribe, then multiply that by a value commensurate with the social class or sheer chutzpah of the target. The higher the bribe, the more likely that it will be requested in currency, rather than goods.
  
  - x $1-100 for the destitute and desperate or the stable but poor.
  - x $100-1,000 for the comfortably employed, the rich, or government/corporate employees.
  - x $1,000-10,000 for minor corporate officers or anyone addressable as "Your Honor/The Honorable".
  - x $10,000-100,000 for anyone who doesn't care about the money and just wants to make your life hard.
  - x $100,000-1,000,000 for CEOs and potentates, who won't consider anything less than a retirement plan.

## Prior Jobs

Your character may be about to start their first job, light on resources but free of debt and consequence. Or, they might be a seasoned criminal, caught in a sprawling web of dubious partnerships and vendettas. Most likely they're somewhere between those two extremes.

When creating your character, decide how many prior jobs you've completed. The GM will impose a maximum number of prior jobs--two to four is a good place to start. For each prior job, roll on the following charts to determine the nature and outcome of the job. If you have a specific history in mind for your character, you may pick results from each table except for "1d4: How Did The Job Go?" and "1d10: How Did You Make Out?" rather than rolling. 

**For each prior job your character has completed, your character owes one favor to another member of the criminal underworld.** These favors are in addition to any favors owed as a result of rolling on the prior jobs tables. Use the "Random Focus/Approach" table to determine the nature of the NPC to whom you owe your favor(s). Even if your character hasn't actively worked in years, word will eventually get around that they're back on the job--you should expect that the GM will have your debtors call in favors owed over the course of the game.

### **Favors** 

Favors and oaths are taken very seriously in the criminal underworld. Sometimes they're represented by physical tokens; more often, they're promised and cashed in among witnesses, backed by the power of professional peer pressure and communal obligation. If a prior job indicates that someone owes you, pick a Focus/Approach combination that represents the NPC and their relation to the prior job that earned you the favor. Alternatively, roll on the "Random Focus/Approach" table. Work with the GM to determine a name and general description for the character. You should expect to be able to cash in the favor during gameplay--material support during another job is generally a reasonable request, but accepting severe risks might require additional considerations, such as completing profitable side tasks or owing a favor in return.

If a prior job indicates that you owe someone else a favor, expect that this NPC will turn up during gameplay and cash in what's owed. Requests with a high risk of injury, imprisonment, or death can be negotiated, but outright refusal immediately lowers your Professional Reputation in the NPC's Focus/Approach category by 3--should they survive to talk about it. Dead men might not talk, but an inconvenient corpse can generate its own problems.

## Character Improvement

After you complete a run, the GM will award each player a number of points to spend improving their character's skills; this represents training pursued during downtime between jobs.

# Equipment

## Money [TODO]

Two kinds of currency: Scrip and Coin. Printed money still exists, but only the government accepts it.

- Scrip is corporate currency. It's tracked, and tradeable between different corporations.
- Coin is untraceable digital currency. You can buy double value in Scrip with it, but can't convert Scrip to Coin.

## Cyberware [TODO: Specifics; Drawbacks?]

Secondhand Cyberware: Functional, but -1d to do anything with it. At least it's not a pegleg. Very cheap.

Baseline Prosthetics: Equivalent to a human limb or sense. Obviously artificial.

Cyberware Replacements: Upgrades over the original meat.

**How is cyberware different from the stuff that justifies having a stat over 6?**
Systemic augmentation increases your base stats and requires weeks of healing and months of adjustment to get the most out of one's newfound abilities, especially if the augmentations are installed during adulthood rather than during the peak mental plasticity of childhood. Given the risks and costs of major surgery, systemic augmentation of children is vanishingly rare, although not unheard-of. Cyberware is an add-on to one's current body, generally providing an entirely new faculty rather than enhancing one's baseline capabilities.

- Options: 
  - Axial upgrades (head, neck, spinal structure, chest)
  - CNS Upgrades (spinal and bodily nerves, brain)
  - Thoracic Upgrades (heart, lungs, endocrine glands)
  - Visceral Upgrades (liver, stomach, intestines)
  - Appendicular upgrades (arms, legs)
  - Sensory Upgrades: 
    - Eyes: Sight
    - Ears: Hearing, balance and acceleration
    - Nose/Tongue: Smell and Taste
    - Skin: Touch, temperature, proprioception
- $2,000 for +1d on any task using the limb or sense.
  - Double the upgrade cost ($4k, $8k, $16k, etc.) for each subsequent upgrade in the location.
  - +$500 for skin-tone coatings that look like flesh at a casual glance, but are obviously fake on inspection, or for cosmetics like anodizing, chromecoating, surface detailing, (holo)graphic overlays, etc.
- 2x the total cost to disguise it as organic to unaugmented examination (-1d to notice).
- 4x the total cost to require high-end scanners to tell the difference between flesh and your limb (-2d to notice).
- 3x the cost of a weapon to integrate it into cyberware. Ammunition is 1/10th this increased cost.
  - Weapons with a Conceal of "Coat" or "N/A" can't be hidden--they're simply too large, and will be apparent even to casual observers.
  - Integrated weapons are illegal and will be removed if the perpetrator is captured alive.
- 3x the cost of armor to integrate it into skin. Dermal armor degrades and self-repairs like standard armor.

Entirely new organs (culture drug glands)? Limb/organ cloning? Full clone replacements?

# Combat

Sometimes negotiations break down. Sometimes someone gets mad. Sometimes an alarm is tripped, and you've got to resort to Plan B. When the knives come out and the air fills with thunder, blood, fear, and cordite, it's important to know who reacts first and how quickly you can find cover.

The wise professional remains aware that the human body is universally allergic to bullets. Neon Sunset is not a game where you can easily eat a blast of automatic gunfire to the chest and laugh about it later over drinks. Extensive rules for combat are presented due to the necessity for precision when determining who lives and who dies. They should not be read as implicit encouragement to rely solely on violence to achieve your various desires.

There will always be those brave, mad, or desperate enough to pursue a trade in violence. Successful warriors require rewards commensurate with the incredible risk of this lifestyle, and the wise retire from the path as quickly as possible. Grenades don't care how many jobs you've got under your belt. Shotguns are unmoved by your reputation. You cannot reason with a knife. You can't spend your Coin if you're dead.

Those who live by the gun almost invariably die by the gun. Consider yourself forewarned.

## [Sidebar] A Note On Battle Maps

If you're going to use a human-scale gridded map for combat, one grid space should equate to 1 square meter. Alternatively, multiply all the meter measurements in the game by 5 foot increments and it'll still work.

## Initiative

When it becomes necessary to determine the order in which people react to something--usually combat, but you never know with these things--each relevant player and NPC rolls **1d10 + Grace + Luck**, the result of which is their initiative. Combat turn order runs from highest to lowest initiative. 

During combat, a character's **turn** represents about three seconds of action. A combat **round** is complete when all characters participating in the combat have taken their turn. Reroll initiative for anyone still active at the start of each new round.

## Actions

On your turn, you can move up to your Speed (at a brisk jog) and use your action to do one significant thing. 

An action can include:

- Moving an additional distance equal to your Speed
- Making one ranged attack
- Reloading a gun with a new magazine, or dumping a heatblock and inserting a new one
- Making two melee attacks
- Starting a hack using Hard methods
- Using a stim or other autoinjector.
- Giving the same command to all your active drones, which immediately comply
- Giving a command to your headware.

## Weapons and Attacks  [TODO: CLEANUP]

Static TN by distance/weapon type, modified by firing mode and cover/circumstance. When attacked, target may lose 4 initiative (if they haven't gone yet, or accept -4 to next round's initiative roll if they've already gone) to replace TN of being hit with roll of 1d10+Grace+Athletics until the next time initiative is rolled. Note: If this roll is flubbed, this can make it *easier* for the target to be hit. Use with caution.

As long as an opponent is aware of you and close enough to strike you in melee combat, it is impossible to make any ranged attacks using thrown weapons or using firearms that require a Coat to conceal or cannot be concealed. Any weapon concealable within your Jacket or smaller can be fired at melee range, but such point-blank attacks are rolled using 1d10+Grace+Brawling.

FA - Full Auto: Attack at -2d. Triple damage listed to one target OR base damage to every target in line of sight within a 10m spread. Empties the magazine.

Melee weapons can be used to attack up to twice each round. Each attack can be directed at a different target.

Objects used as improvised weapons in melee or ranged combat deal your Brawling damage. Many objects, but especially those not designed for combat, break after one solid hit or block/parry.

A full magazine of standard cased ammunition costs 1/10th the price of the weapon firing it.

Power Melee weapons require a heatblock to function; without one, they deal half damage (round down).
Ranged weapons that fire bullets can use cased ammunition, or can be converted to use a heatblock.
Bows and crossbows can only fire arrows and bolts, respectively. They cannot use heatblock technology.
Rocket and grenade launchers require their respective explosives to function and cannot use heatblock technology.

### Wielding Multiple Weapons

When you attack with more than one weapon as part of an Action, all your attacks suffer -2d. If you attack distinct targets, roll damage for each target individually. If you attack the same target, roll damage twice and apply the higher result. If the weapons used are not of an identical type and, if applicable, ammunition type, all your attacks suffer a total of -3d.

### [Sidebar] Magic

If your cyberpunk setting features magic, here's a simple ruleset for weapon-like spells. 

You know a number of attack spells equal to your Luck stat. For each one, pick a weapon from the list as your basic template for the damage, range, and noise of a spell. All damage dice rolled are one step higher (d6s become d8s, d10s become d12s). Define what each spell looks and sounds like--a magical attack is never subtle and always obviously supernatural.

Casting a spell takes as long as aiming and firing a gun. It requires you to point at least one finger in the direction of the target, and the spell physically travels from you to the target--cover and concealment apply. A new skill, "Combat Magic", is used for your attack roll: 1d10 + [the highest of your Grace, Charm, or Lore] + Combat Magic. You can't learn Combat Magic after character creation; you're either born with this life-changing talent or not. If you start with it, however, you can spend skill points to increase your rank.

Casting a spell deals damage to YOU equal to the spell's number of damage dice (a 3d6 spell deals 3 damage to you). You can cast a spell as the equivalent of burst fire or full auto, but this doubles or triples, respectively, the damage your spell deals to you as you channel more power to cast it. Headshots are possible at the usual penalty to attack, but also incur triple damage to the caster from the additional effort required to precisely control the spell. A spell cast as a full auto headshot would deal 9x damage to the caster. If casting a spell would drop you to 0 health or lower, you finish casting your spell before you start dying.

Anyone capable of Combat Magic can identify another spellcaster by staring into their eyes for a full minute, tasting anything that is or was part of their body, or touching them while they sleep. Carefully consider how your setting's institutions, common people, and career criminals feel about the existence and use of magic.

To maintain genre conventions, it is the author's suggestion that non-combat magic--if it exists--remain incapable of time travel, teleportation, or the resurrection of the dead. Your call.

## Modifying Weapons

It is possible to modify a weapon's performance. Begin with a base weapon listed in the chart above. These represent the most common configuration of a weapon of that type, available in a vast array of colors, materials, and brands.

Weapons have damage, range, concealment, rate of fire, ammo type, and noise categories. You can modify all of these qualities. Weapon modification isn't hard, but extensive changes get complicated quickly. Note that all weapon modification or the possession of a modified weapon is illegal.

Modifying a weapon is a **TN 10 Lore+Technology check**. Each subsequent modification to the weapon increases the TN by 5. The first modification costs $500. Each subsequent modification doubles that cost. Failing the check to modify a weapon eats the cash in repair fees if you want to repair your otherwise useless weapon.

Modifications that would increase a weapon quality above a listed maximum value or below a minimum value are not possible. Modifications must be implemented one change at a time.

A + or - indicates one step up or down on that category's units. A weapon may modified to swap from using cased ammunition to heatblock technology or vice versa. 

**Damage: (min) 1d6/2d6/3d6/4d6/5d6/6d6 (max)**

- +damage = +noise. Also, either -range OR worse concealment.
- -damage = -noise. Also, either +range OR better concealment

**Range: (min) Melee/Close/Short/Medium/Long/Extreme (max)**

- +range = +noise OR -damage OR worse concealment
- -range = -noise OR -damage OR better concealment

**Concealment: (min) Pocket/Jacket/Coat/Not Possible (max)**

- better concealment (smaller gun) = -damage OR -range
- worse concealment (larger gun) = +damage OR +range

**Rate of Fire: (min) Semiauto, Burst, Full Auto (max)**

- +RoF = -damage OR -range
- -RoF = +damage OR +range

**Noise: (min) Quiet, Room, Floor, Building, Block, Mile (max)**

- -noise = -damage OR -range OR better concealment
- +noise = +damage OR +range OR worse concealment (THE LOUDENER)

### Variant Ammunition

Most guns fire cased ammunition--bullets and shells as you know them. When using cased ammunition, track each bullet (probably on scratch paper). You'll never be surprised when you run out of ammunition. 

A full magazine of standard cased ammunition costs 1/10th the price of the weapon firing it.

Any weapon that fires cased ammunition can use these variant ammunition types. Cased ammunition can have more than one of these qualities; just stack all the price multipliers together. All variant ammunition requires a military license to own or fire.

- Armor Piercing: 2x cost. Halve the effective value of armor struck by this round, but also halve the damage dealt. AP rounds are small and dense--this is great for piercing ballistic weave and plating, but tends to go straight through meat and only leave a tiny hole behind it. Cannot be combined with expanding rounds.
- Expanding: 2x cost. Double the effective value of armor struck by this round, but double any damage dealt. The opposite of an AP round, this one readily flattens out on impact and leaves big, messy wounds. Cannot be combined with armor piercing rounds.
- Incendiary: 4x cost. This ammunition ignites anything it strikes that is flammable. People, plastic, and structural wood are all readily flammable. Burning targets take 1d6 damage at the start of every round and make all checks with disadvantage; spend an action to roll under Grace to put out the flames.
- Explosive: 4x cost. +1d6 damage. Cannot be applied to weapons that deal 3d6 damage or less; there's not enough room in the shell to fit a useful amount of explosive. Don't worry about your rounds cooking off if you catch fire or get blown up; anything that can detonate modern explosive ammunition has probably already detonated *you*.
- Shotshells: 00 buckshot. This ammunition can hit two adjacent targets with a single shot. This is the default type of cased ammunition for shotguns, and cannot be used in weapons that aren't shotguns unless the weapon is modified to only accept shotgun shells.
- Slugs: +1d6 damage, one target only. Worse range than a rifle, but often easier to acquire than a new gun. Only usable in shotguns.
- Dragonsbreath: As incendiary cased ammunition, but ignites everything in a 30m line. Only usable in shotguns.

### **Heatblocks** [TODO: CLEANUP]

A miniaturized combination of plasma cutter and coilgun, heatblock weapons accept a small brick of metal in place of cased ammunition. Aerodynamic slivers are shaved off the block by plasma arc and magnetically accelerated through the barrel, while waste heat is recycled into liquid metal thermal batteries. If allowed to cool after firing, the weapon can produce thousands of shots from a single block of mundane metal. Sustained rapid fire, however, can overheat the weapon and will automatically lock the trigger until the gun has cooled. Users can manually vent heat into the block, eject it, and swap in a cold block as fast as a conventional weapon could accept a fresh magazine. Civilian possession of heatblock weapons is generally illegal. Unsurprisingly, black market instructions for the creation of heatblock weapons have been available for years.

- Mechanics: When using a heatblock weapon, don't track individual shots. At the end of a round in which a heatblock weapon was fired in semiauto, burst fire, or full auto mode, roll a number of d6s equal to the weapon's damage dice. Roll one additional d6 if the weapon was used for burst fire, or two additional d6s if the weapon was used for full auto. If any of the dice rolled show a six, the weapon has overheated and cannot be fired for a number of rounds equal to the weapon's damage dice (example: 3d6 damage, 3 rounds to cool down). Alternatively, the weapon can be readied to fire again immediately if the overheated block is ejected and a fresh block is inserted. Note that ejecting an overheated block drops a molten lump of metal at the user's feet.

## Melee Attacks [TODO: clean up presentation]

Opposed rolls. 

- Attacker rolls the appropriate skill for the method used to strike (generally 1d10+Grace+Swordplay or 1d10+Might+Brawling). 

- Defender has two options: Block/Parry or Dodge.

  - Block/Parry: Roll 1d10+Grace+Swordplay or 1d10+Might+Brawling to defend against the same. A melee weapon is required to block/parry against a melee weapon; an improvised weapon can be used at -1d. Brawling can be used to defend against swordplay if the defender has at least one cyberlimb. 

    - If Attacker's roll meets or beats Defender's roll, Attacker deals full damage. 

      If Attacker fails to meet or beat Defender's roll, both roll damage; Attacker's damage dealt is reduced by defender's damage roll (minimum zero). Attacker can't take damage from rolling low when the Defender rolls high.

  - Dodge: Defender rolls 1d10+Grace+Athletics. 

    - If Attack's roll meets or beats Defender's roll, Attacker deals full damage. 
    - If Attacker fails to meet or beat Defender's roll, the blow is avoided and Attacker deals no damage.

## Armor

Armor costs $100 per point and is always purchased in 5-point increments. Armor reduces damage by 1 for every point of armor. There are two locations for wearing armor: Body and Head. Helmets are purchased separately from body armor. 

Wearing a helmet inflicts -1d per 10 head armor *after the first 5* on Perception checks.

Your Grace is reduced by 1 for every 10 points of body armor worn *after the first 5*.

Damage that penetrates armor reduces that armor's value by 1. Modern armor is made using self-repairing polymers and will restore itself to its original protective state after 24 hours without suffering ballistic shock. Armor that has self-repaired tends to display telltale tessellated scarring.

ARMOR 10 - concealable, civilian license
ARMOR 15 - flack vest, civilian license
ARMOR 20 - armorgel jack, military license
ARMOR 25 - gel coat + plate vest, military license
ARMOR 30 - combat hardsuit, military license. Built-in linear frame (MIGHT = 8).


Armor exists at 30+, but requires so much mechanical assistance and engineering support that it is effectively an enclosed, powered exosuit and requires a military license and an auto-repair shop's worth of specialized equipment.

All attacks are assumed to be aimed at a target's center of mass. Hitting a specific location (a person's head or joint; a visible fuel tank on a moving vehicle) imposes -2d on a ranged attack roll or -1d in melee. Headshots apply armor, then triple any remaining damage.

## Cover and Concealment

**Some good advice: *First* take cover, *then* return fire.**

**Cover** is anything you put between you and a bullet that's likely to stop or deflect a shot. **Concealment** is anything that makes it harder for the enemy to figure out where to shoot in order to hit you at all. Most things that'll stop a bullet are opaque--broken drones, hot dog carts, horses--and so most cover also provides concealment. Bulletproof glass would provide cover without also granting concealment; use context and your best judgement to figure out cases like that.

If an object obscures at least half your body, you benefit from using it as cover and/or concealment if you're on the other side of it from your attacker. Cover and concealment don't apply if an attacker is close enough to strike their target in melee combat. Cover is effective as described against explosions. Anything that has a special effect on armor has the same effect on the armor provided by cover.

Cover and concealment are very common, but they won't keep you alive forever. Many objects are dense enough to serve as useful cover. Unlike modern ballistic armor, however, they're rarely durable enough to survive sustained gunfire. If something you're using as cover is dealt enough damage that the shot pierces the armor it grants and actually hits you, that bit of cover shatters, crumbles, or is otherwise destroyed. Don't bother tracking a bit of cover's reduced armor after each shot--it's not worth it.

|    Cover Type    |                   Examples                   | Concealment Type |  Attacker Penalty   |                     Description/Examples                     |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Light: 10 Armor  |   Drywall, Wooden Crates, Cheap Furniture    |      Light       |         -1d         | A vague shape is visible, but no details. Light fog, a backlit sheet. Thermographic signature through an opaque obstacle. Target shooting from behind cover. |
| Medium: 30 Armor |    Engine Block, Concrete Traffic Barrier    |      Medium      |         -2d         | Aware of target, but no direct visual. Heavy smoke. Loud noises from the other side of a wall. Target trying to stay entirely behind cover. |
| Heavy: 50 Armor  | Exterior Wall, Stalled Tank, Bank Vault Door |     Complete     | Attack Not Possible | You're just guessing. Complete darkness without augmented vision. You're blind. Target is invisible. |

## Damage

Humans have health equal to their GRIT * 6. Health directly represents your body's ability to function despite physical trauma. When an attack deals damage, you are physically wounded and suffer terrible pain; when an attack reduces you to 0 health, your mind and body finally give out and you hit the dirt. 

For reference, an unarmored human can suffer a couple shots to the body or one shot to the head with a pistol before dying. If death isn't instantaneous, it'll take them about 20 to 30 seconds to bleed out, go into shock, and die.

## Death

### Body Shots and Bleeding Out

If reduced to 0 health by a hit to the body, you're dying. You'll expire at the end of a number of rounds equal to your GRIT if you don't receive first aid before the end of that final round. You can act while you're dying, but you suffer a -2d penalty to all actions.

### Headshots and Instant Death

If a headshot reduced you to 0 health, you are immediately knocked unconscious. You will die at the end of the next round unless you receive first aid AND successfully roll 1d10 under your LUCK. If a single attack deals more than 20 points of damage beyond what is currently required to drop you to 0 health, you are instantly, spectacularly slain.

## Dismemberment

When you are reduced to 0 health for the first time during a job, roll 1d6 to see where the blow landed. Reroll impossible results. Then, roll 1d10. If the result is even, survival earns you a gnarly scar. If the result is odd, the location has been severed or otherwise mangled.

| Roll |              Location Struck               |          Effect until Repaired/Replaced          |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|  1   |       Leg (random side and portion)        |        Speed reduced to 1 meter per round        |
|  2   |       Arm (random side and portion)        |    Obvious drawbacks of one or no hands/arms     |
| 3-5  | Torso (random side/upper/lower/back/front) | -1d to all rolls. Die in GRIT days unless fixed. |
|  6   |           Face (random feature)            |      -2d to non-hostile social interactions      |

## Healing

### First Aid

Anyone trained in the Medicine skill can tend to physical wounds. Roll 1d10+Lore+Medicine against TN 10. 

First Aid restores Health equal to the result of the check - 10. This process of assessment and application requires 10 minutes, access to basic medical supplies, and a lack of overt distractions. For each unfulfilled requirement, the amount of restored health is reduced by an additional 5 (minimum 0 health restored). The check may be reattempted if no health was restored, but the time requirement doubles for each consecutive check on the same subject within 48 hours.

Similarly, one may attempt to stabilize a character that has been reduced to 0 Health and is bleeding out. This process takes a number of rounds equal to 1d10 - the subject's Grit, at the end of which the attending character rolls as described above. If any Health would be restored, the subject is stabilized at 0 Health until more significant treatment or a new wound is received. Further First Aid may be immediately administered to restore the subject's Health.

### Emergency Medical Attention

Surgical clinics and hospitals are great for recovery, but one tends not to get shot outside the door of an operating theater. For combat zone wounds, you get combat zone treatment: **Stims.** 

A stim is any of hundreds of proprietary pharmaceutical blends of stimulants, clotting agents, and wound-knitting metamaterials delivered through an autoinjector. Stims can be used as first aid to automatically stop a dying character from bleeding out. They're designed for battlefield wounds; they'll heal a bullet, not a tumor or the trauma of major surgery.

Drawing and using a stim requires one action. A stim reduces the user's maximum Health by 5, then immediately restores the user's health to the new maximum. The reduction to the user's maximum Health lasts for 48 hours after the most recent stim use. Stim users commonly report a persistent metallic taste in their mouth until the drug wears off.

Reducing your maximum Health to zero or lower triggers organ failure, unconsciousness, and death within GRIT hours unless medical care can be administered at a hospital or clinic. Health is restored from 0 to the former maximum of GRIT * 6 at one point per day of treatment.

### Long-Term Healing

You restore one Health per day while going about the business of simply living. Complete bed rest restores three Health per day. Hospital or clinic care restores five Health per day of active treatment. 

Immersion in a recuperative tank of biofluid restores fifteen Health per day of treatment *as long as the subject's brain is intact*. While a damaged brain cannot be restored, tank treatment regenerates any other missing limbs, organs, senses, or genetic curiosities possessed at birth after three full days of treatment. Tank treatment costs $30,000 to access plus an additional $3,000 for each day of treatment.

# Hacking: Headware and an AMP

***Are you free, or are you safe?***

In the past, hacking required extensive knowledge of computer protocols, scripting and programming expertise, and a lengthy observation and probing of a prospective target. Today, it works by MAGIC: Multi-Agentic Gray-matter-Integrated Colloid. 

Only the terminally enthusiastic call it MAGIC, though; most call it **headware**.

**[TODO: Put everything that isn't directly related to a player capability or game mechanic into WORD JAIL.]** Headware is a nanomachine slurry that a corporation will pay you (?) to inject (?) into your brain. It takes a month to integrate, after which you have a smartphone and personal assistant expert system in your brain forever, and the corporation gets an interface through which to advertise to you forever. Headware is powered by a negligible bioelectric draw, and uses an ear clip transcranial magnetic stimulation unit with retractable universal data cable for input, output, and storage. The TMS unit includes a compact wireless antenna with an open-air range of about 100m **[WORD JAIL, except for the 100m part]**. You can install and run apps on your headware--as long as they're signed by a corporation. **[WORD JAIL]**

This was mostly a cool toy until someone (???) invented the Archaeometric Meta-Protocol. An AMP scans existing network topologies by reading optical and electrical signal "contrails". It uses solipsistic predictive modeling systems to reinterpret the data in a format that a mind-computer interface like your headware can parse. Essentially, an AMP is a Rosetta Stone that translates arbitrary networked information systems into intuitive mental images in humans. There's a whitepaper, but almost everybody who claims to understand it is full of shit. There are thousands of different implementations of AMP, minutely reconfigured to individual preferences.

**[THIS ENTIRE PARAGRAPH GOES TO WORD JAIL]** AMP's interpretive ability is not unlimited. The longer a signal has traveled through a small area and the stronger that signal is or was, the more easily an AMP can interpret the signal's contrail. Old, large, local, or high-power networks are easy for AMP to interpret. Young, small, distant, or low-power networks are harder to parse. Networks with no active signal running through them are impossible to interpret. Likewise, AMP can't be used to generate arbitrary code--it's an interpreter and interface, not a programming language--but, with a little tampering, it can be used to *inject and execute* arbitrary code within a network that it is interpreting.

If you have headware, you can use your brain to do anything a smartphone could do in 2019, in exchange for a sponsoring corporation keeping permanent tabs on you. If you "free" your headware--circumventing the protective corporate code that prevents unauthorized uses--you drop off the corporate tracking grid and can run anything written for the platform, even if it isn't approved. **[THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE GOES TO WORD JAIL UNLESS YOU CAN WRITE AN INTERESTING MECHANIC FOR IT]** If you install an AMP, you can literally see computer networks. If you've done all these things and you're very clever, you can use your AMP to directly manipulate those networks with your brain.

## How_2_Hacking

Hacking means using any networked computer to gather information or gain control of an electronic device--usually information or a device that someone else doesn't want you to access.

A tremendous amount of "hacking" doesn't require any illegal activity. There's a breathtaking amount of information freely available on the Internet, and a series of simple Google searches isn't going to trigger many alarms. Likewise, the weakest link in any security system is human. It's often easier to trick, bribe, or apply rubber-hose cryptanalysis in order to extract data from someone than it is to actually hack a system. Further, some very rare networks are rendered virtually unhackable due to their difficulty of access. Physical and information security is a balance between defense and convenience; a laptop embedded in a concrete sphere, wrapped in a faraday cage, and sunk to the bottom of the Mariana Trench is extremely secure, but rather inconvenient to access. Most systems strike a more reasonable balance, and a prospective hacker is advised to hone their social skills--or befriend someone who has--as well as their technical expertise; some common sense in the service of recognizing unfavorable targets is also useful. 

Yet those who dare, win. If they say the sysadmin is incorruptible and the server can't be reached unless you can gargle neurotoxin, that just means nobody's done it yet.

### Procedure

All hacking attempts are performed with a roll of **1d10 + Lore + Technology**.

First, decide if you want **Control** or **Information**. If you're hacking for control, name the device you're trying to control. If you're hacking for information, ask the question you're trying to answer.

- Hacking for **control** provides a brief window of control over a physical device or electronic system within 100m that has a network connection. Hacking for access could, for example, open an electronic lock, control an elevator, start or control a vehicle, or provide commands to a surveillance system. It couldn't detonate grenades on someone's belt (they aren't networked) or fire an orbital satellite weapon (it's not within 100m).
- Hacking for **information** provides the answer to a single question of objective fact which is not available to the general public. Each question answered requires a separate roll. Hacking for information can answer questions like "Where does the VP of Research for *Tarokoten Exploration Unlimited* live," or "What is the standard armament of *Tarokoten* corporate security," or "Which corporations and nation-states do not currently have extradition agreements with *Tarokoten* or its subsidiaries?" It couldn't answer questions like "What is the best way to kidnap a corporate executive," (there is no single best answer) or "Is our driver trustworthy," (there's no objective answer) or "Is the bodega down the street open" (hacking isn't necessary to answer this question).

Second, decide if you want to attempt the hack using **Hard** or **Soft** methods.

- **Hard** methods are very fast, but inefficient. If you're using a physical computer, you risk damaging the hardware. If you're using headware, you risk damage to your health. You can mitigate this damage by using **backup hardware** or injecting units of **CSF coolant**.
  - The base time required to execute a Hard hack is 1d10 rounds.
  - Using Hard methods in pursuit of Access has a base difficulty of TN 15.
  - Using Hard methods in pursuit of Information has a base difficulty of TN 20.

- **Soft** methods are slow, but efficient. No matter what kind of device you're using, you risk exposing information about yourself--your location, your goals, and your personal identity. You can protect yourself from exposure by **hacking from an unimportant location** or employing a **fake identity**.
  - The base time required to execute a Soft hack is 4 hours.
  - Using Soft methods in pursuit of Access has a base difficulty of TN 20.
  - Using Soft methods in pursuit of Information has a base difficulty of TN 15.

While you're executing a hack, you're free to perform other actions so long as the computer or headware you're using to hack isn't used for another task or destroyed.

**Speed Effects on Hacking**

|  Method  |    -3d    |     -2d      |    -1d     |  Baseline   |    +1d     |    +2d     |    +3d     |
| :------: | :-------: | :----------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| **Hard** |  1 round  | 1d6/2 rounds | 1d6 rounds | 1d10 rounds | 2d6 rounds | 3d6 rounds | 4d6 rounds |
| **Soft** | 5 minutes |  30 minutes  |  2 hours   |   4 hours   |  8 hours   |  24 hours  |  48 hours  |

**Security/Access Effects on Hacking**

|       -3d        |        -2d        |          -1d           |                 Baseline                 |     +1d      |      +2d      |       +3d       |
| :--------------: | :---------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
| Corporate System | Government System | Organized Crime System | Public System/Private Citizen/No Account | User Account | Admin Account | Physical Access |

Getting a legitimate **account** on a system containing your desired information or device access is hugely beneficial. While a lack of legitimate access won't stymie a skilled hacker, even a basic user account offers major insight into the workings of a system. Admin accounts are even more useful, and there's virtually nothing more effective than gaining physical access to a computer in order to (literally or figuratively) crack it open. User accounts are gained as easily as signing up for a service or posing as an employee. Admin accounts are rare, but there's always at least one person who has one. Gaining physical access to a computer system may be an entire job on its own.

### **Success**

**A successful hack for control** allows a hacker to give commands to a device for 1d10 rounds before the system boots them out. Control of a device allows the hacker to perform any normal function of that device, to shut down the device, lock out other users from changing the device's current state, or to insert code that will cause the device to destroy itself at any point up to and including the final round in which the hacker controls the device.

**A successful hack for information** reveals the answer to the question asked or subject researched. A hack for information has no relevant duration; long-term monitoring of a system is not possible without a legitimate account. If a hacker wants to delete information from a system, a hack for access is required.

### Failing a Hard Hack

Failing a hack using Hard methods inflicts a number of d6s in damage equal to the number of disadvantages suffered on the hacking roll (minimum 1d6).

If the failed Hard hack was attempted using headware, this damage is inflicted directly to the hacker as their brain overheats. Damage can be mitigated using injections of **cerebrospinal fluid coolant (CSFC)**. Each unit of CSFC costs $500 and reduces incoming damage by 1d6 before the damage is rolled. Injecting a unit of CSFC takes an action. A human can contain a number of units of CSFC equal to their Grit stat, and units of CSFC are naturally excreted (used or not) after 24 hours. Injecting more units of CSFC than the body can support is very dangerous, reducing Charm and Lore stats by 1 for each unit beyond the body's capacity. The reduction to Charm and Lore requires a week of hospital treatment to reverse by 1d6 points; any reduction not cured by hospital treatment is permanent brain damage.

If the failed Hard hack was attempted using an external computer, the damage is inflicted to the computer itself as portions of the hardware overheat. A baseline computer has 10 Health. A set of **backup hardware** costs $500 and reduces incoming damage by 1d6 before the damage is rolled, after which the backup hardware--disposable heatsinks, ablative processor extensions, etc.--is destroyed. Installing backup hardware takes one round. If a computer's Health is reduced to 0 by damage from a failed Hard hack, the computer catastrophically overheats and bursts into flame. 

The base health of a computer can be improved by installing durable liquid metal cooling or other redundant systems, but this increases the size of the computer and quickly renders it inconvenient to transport.

| Base Computer Health | Additional Cost |          Approximate Size          |

|          10          |       $0        |       Slim Laptop or Tablet        |

### Failing a Soft Hack

When you fail a hack using Soft methods, roll on the following chart.

| Result | Information Potentially Revealed |
| :----: | :------------------------------: |
|  1-3   |             Location             |
|  4-5   |             Identity             |
|   6    |              Intent              |

The roll's result is the information that is at risk of being revealed. [TODO: Add HEAT effects to all of these.]

- **Location:** The owners of the system containing your requested information learn where you are, physically, right now.
- **Identity:** Your civilian license is revealed to your target. They know who you are--or at least whomever is listed on the license you're using.
- **Intent:** The subject of your query (or their security team) is alerted to the question you asked about them. They have no idea who asked it. Yet.

Having failed the hack, you have two options: 1) abandon the attempt, or 2) press your luck. If you abandon the attempt, you don't get the answer to your question and your information is revealed. If you press your luck, you can reroll your hack with a -1d penalty; success on this check answers the question without revealing any information about you; failure gives you no answers and reveals not only the rolled information, but an additional roll on the chart as well. If the information revealed from failing to press your luck matches the information from the initial roll, you got lucky--sort of--and have only revealed a single category of info about yourself.

The most expedient defense against self-revelation is to hack from unimportant locations--public areas with tremendous traffic, places your target can't or won't chase you, or simply a new location for every attempted hack. 

You can also purchase a **fake civilian license** in varying qualities. A basic fake license costs $500 and provides a 1-in-6 chance to protect against a revelation of your identity. Each additional chance out of six to protect your identity doubles the cost of the license. A fake civilian license can sustain a number of flags equal to the chance out of six it has to protect you before being permanently flagged as fake and rendered useless. License status is public; anyone can check if a civilian license has been permanently flagged as a fake.

# It's Easy To Be A Weapons-Grade Motherfucker

As a career criminal, being an absolute bastard is trivial. Doing things with respect for the value of human life is much harder. Worthwhile? Maybe. 

Write about that here; maybe talk about what kind of game you're gonna run--do you put people in k-holes and threaten the lives of their family? Do you kill casually? Do you rob from the rich and give to the poor?

# NPC Gallery

Note to self/don't include this? Some NPC rules:

Most NPCs are Common People. 3 in every stat, 2 ranks in the Common skills. Don't bother defining Areas of Expertise; just roll everything without reduction.

If someone's an Extra, give them a Focus template. Determine their Approach, but only for roleplaying context; there aren't meaningful statblock changes that come from Approach for an NPC.
- Focus Templates
	- Combat: +2 Might, Grace, or Luck. +2 to two skills from Perception, Shooting, Athletics, Brawling, or Swordplay. Reload without an Action. +1d on all attacks. 
		- Gear: 15 head/body armor (-1 Grace), melee weapon, ranged weapon. $2,000 of additional gear.
	- Social: +2 Charm, Lore, or Luck. +2 to two skills from Perception, Tracking, Streetwise, Stealth, or Manipulate. +1d on all Manipulate checks. Reroll a Manipulate check 1/session. 
		- Gear: 10 body armor, ranged weapon. $2,000 of additional gear.
	- Tech: +2 Grit, Lore, or Luck. +2 to two skills from Technology, Streetwise, Driving, Medicine, or Manipulate. +1d on Technology checks. 
		- Gear: 20 armor head/body (-1 Grace), ranged or melee weapon, tools relevant to skills. $2,000 of additional gear.

Basically 4 tiers of NPCS:
	Common People - About 4/5ths of all the NPCs you'll meet.
	Extras - Common People with a Focus template. 
	Professionals - Common People with a Focus template and a number of Prior Jobs.
	Major Characters - The PCs, and any major opposition they might face. Major Characters are created as if they were PCs, complete with spending money on gear and cyberware.
