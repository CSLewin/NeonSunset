HEAT
But yeah, a chart for the GM. Something like...

- Someone with a civilian license reported a crime: +1
- The crime is violent: +2
- The crime is happening in an area that hasn't already been abandoned to urban chaos: +2
- The crime involves firearms: +2
- The crime involves automatic firearms or other military weapons: +10
- The crime report involves large-scale arson or explosives: +5
- The crime involves someone with corporate citizenship: +5
- There's more than two suspects: +2
- Any suspects have obvious cyberware: +2

Levels of response:
5: A two-man police patrol (or three-man corporate patrol) arrives in 1d6*10 minutes. Armed with flack vests and pistols.

10: The cop/corp patrol has an additional member and carry automatic weapons.

15: 2d6 patrols dispatched with automatic weapons and one aerial support vehicle.

20: Urban Combat Unit deployed. Three 5-man teams with combat plate, automatic weapons, CS grenades, cyberware, tactical network support and a remote corporate hacker. 1d6 aerial support vehicles.

25+: YOU WOKE THE HIVE. 1d6 UCU elements deployed, public transport closed, bridges blocked. Buckle up.

the cops are just a malevolent, omnipresent threat meter
Which might not actually be the worst way to model it
Do illegal shit, but don't to very illegal shit in rapid succession
The HEAT METER
Steal a car?  +2 heat

Shoot a guy in an alley?  +5 heat

Get on the news with a picture of your face holding a LAW?  +30 heat
Kidnap?  +target's wealth heat
Reload while running at a dead sprint? +Val Kilmer heat

Yeah that last bit is a joke, but algorithmic enforcement is probably a realistic thing. It would also mean that local gangs have a reason to self police, and it would explain why gifted hackers are employed by these same people

There's your hacker unique, too.  They can do things to the HEAT level, either pre or post operation
Fucking with the Heat level sounds like a great trick, yeah
Cranking a rival gang's heat level by +10 or something would be a hell of an opening to an offensive
